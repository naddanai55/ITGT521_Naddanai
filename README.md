### The Triangle Awakens
**Overview:**
This project is a simple example of triangle scan conversion in OpenGL using a frame buffer. The program lets users create a triangle on a 400x300 pixel frame by clicking on three points, which represent the vertices of the triangle.

### How to Use
1. **Draw a Triangle:** Use the left mouse button to click three points within the window, which will act as the vertices of the triangle.
2. **Display:** After the third point is clicked, the program fills the triangle with interpolated colors between the three vertices, displaying it in the frame buffer.

### A New Plane
**Overview:**
Drawing a 3D airplane rendered in OpenGL. It displays two side-by-side views:
1. A camera-following perspective
2. A fixed top-down view.
The airplane’s movements and the camera’s position can be independently controlled

### Controls
***Plane Controls:***
***Translation***
- W: Move the plane forward (positive Z)
- S: Move the plane backward (negative Z)
- A: Move the plane left (positive X)
- D: Move the plane right (negative X)
- T: Move the plane up (positive Y)
- R: Move the plane down (negative Y)

***Rotation***
- G: Roll the plane clockwise (positive Z)
- F: Roll the plane counterclockwise (negative Z)
- Z: Pitch the plane up (positive X)
- X: Pitch the plane down (negative X)
- C: Yaw the plane left (positive Y)
- V: Yaw the plane right (negative Y)
  
***Camera Controls***
***Translation***
- U: Move the camera forward (negative Z)
- J: Move the camera backward (positive Z)
- H: Move the camera left (negative X)
- K: Move the camera right (positive X)
- O: Move the camera up (positive Y)
- L: Move the camera down (negative Y)

***Rotation***
- N: Roll the camera counterclockwise (negative Z)
- M: Roll the camera clockwise (positive Z)
- ,: Pitch the camera up (negative X)
- .: Pitch the camera down (positive X)
- [: Yaw the camera left (negative Y)
- ]: Yaw the camera right (positive Y)
